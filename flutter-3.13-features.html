                            <h1>What is Flutter?</h1>
                            <br/>

                            <p>Flutter is an open-source UI toolkit created by Google. It is used to build beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, desktop, and embedded devices from a single codebase. Flutter is known for its fast development
                                speed, high performance, and expressive and flexible UI.</p>

                            <p>Flutter is a cross-platform framework, which means that you can use it to build apps that run on both Android and iOS. This can save you a lot of time and effort, as you don't need to develop two separate apps.</p>

                            <p>Flutter is also a very performant framework. Apps built with Flutter are typically very fast and responsive. This is because Flutter uses a technique called "hot reload," which allows you to see your changes to the code instantly
                                in the app.</p>

                            <p>Flutter is an expressive and flexible UI framework. It comes with a wide range of widgets that you can use to build your UI. You can also create custom widgets to meet your specific needs.</p>

                            <p>Flutter is a popular framework for building mobile apps. It is used by a number of well-known companies, including Google, Alibaba, and eBay.</p>

                            <p>If you are looking for a fast, performant, and expressive UI framework, Flutter is a great option.</p>

                            <p>Here are some of the benefits of using Flutter:</p>

                            <ul>

                                <li><b>High performance: </b> Flutter apps are typically very fast and responsive. This is because Flutter uses a technique called "rasterization" to render its UI.</li>

                            <h1>Dynamic colors
                            </h1>
                            <br/>
                            <p>Dynamic colors is a new feature in Flutter 3.13 that allows you to create beautiful and personalized user interfaces by using dynamic colors. Dynamic colors are colors that are derived from the user's wallpaper or other elements
                                of the user interface. This means that your app can have a cohesive and consistent look and feel, regardless of the user's wallpaper or device.</p>

                            <p>To use dynamic colors, you need to use the MaterialApp widget. This widget will automatically apply the dynamic colors to your app. You can also customize the dynamic colors by using the colorScheme property.</p>

                            <p>The dynamic colors are based on the principles of color theory. They use a combination of primary, secondary, and accent colors to create a harmonious and balanced look. The primary color is the most dominant color in the app,
                                and it is typically used for the app's primary brand colors. The secondary color is used for less prominent elements in the app, such as buttons and text. And the accent color is used for accents, such as borders and highlights.</p>

                            <p>The dynamic colors are also responsive to the user's environment. For example, if the user is using a dark wallpaper, the dynamic colors will be adjusted to be darker. This ensures that your app is always easy to read and use,
                                regardless of the user's environment.</p>

                            <p>Dynamic colors are a powerful new feature that can be used to create beautiful and personalized user interfaces. They are easy to use and can be customized to match your app's branding. If you are looking to create a modern
                                and stylish app, dynamic colors are a great option.</p>

                            <p>Here are some examples of how you can use dynamic colors in your app:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Use the primary color for the app's main branding elements, such as the app icon and splash screen.</li>
                                <li>Use the secondary color for less prominent elements, such as buttons and text.</li>
                                <li>Use the accent color for accents, such as borders and highlights.</li>
                                <li>Customize the dynamic colors to match your app's branding.</li>
                                <li>Use the dynamic colors to create a cohesive and consistent look and feel across your app.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                            <h1>Personalized typography</h1>
                            <br/>
                            <p>Personalized typography is a new feature in Flutter 3.13 that allows you to create beautiful and personalized user interfaces by using personalized typography. Personalized typography is typography that is adapted to the user's
                                preferences. This means that your app can have a cohesive and consistent look and feel, regardless of the user's preferences.</p>

                            <p>To use personalized typography, you need to use the MaterialApp widget. This widget will automatically apply the personalized typography to your app. You can also customize the personalized typography by using the textTheme
                                property.
                            </p>

                            <p>The personalized typography is based on the principles of typography. It uses a combination of font family, font size, and font weight to create a harmonious and balanced look. The font family is the family of fonts that are
                                used in the app. The font size is the size of the fonts that are used in the app. And the font weight is the thickness of the fonts that are used in the app.</p>

                            <p>The personalized typography is also responsive to the user's environment. For example, if the user is using a large screen, the font size will be adjusted to be larger. This ensures that your app is always easy to read and
                                use, regardless of the user's environment.</p>

                            <p>Personalized typography is a powerful new feature that can be used to create beautiful and personalized user interfaces. They are easy to use and can be customized to match your app's branding and the user's preferences. If
                                you are looking to create a modern and stylish app, personalized typography is a great option.</p>

                            <p>Here are some examples of how you can use personalized typography in your app:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Use a font family that is easy to read and that matches your app's branding.</li>
                                <li>Use a font size that is appropriate for the content and the user's environment.</li>
                                <li>Use a font weight that is appropriate for the content and the user's environment.</li>
                                <li>Customize the personalized typography to match your app's branding and the user's preferences.</li>
                                <li>Use the personalized typography to create a cohesive and consistent look and feel across your app.</li>

                            <h1>Fluid motion</h1>
                            <br/>

                            <p>Fluid motion is a new feature in Flutter 3.13 that allows you to create beautiful and natural-looking motion in your user interfaces. Fluid motion is based on the principles of physics and animation. It uses a combination of
                                easing curves, spring physics, and damping to create smooth and natural-looking motion.</p>

                            <p>To use fluid motion, you need to use the AnimatedBuilder widget. This widget will automatically apply the fluid motion to your animation. You can also customize the fluid motion by using the curve and physics properties.</p>

                            <p>The curve property controls the shape of the animation curve. The physics property controls the physical properties of the animation, such as the spring constant and damping coefficient.</p>

                            <p>The fluid motion is also responsive to the user's environment. For example, if the user is using a slow device, the animation will be slowed down. This ensures that your app's motion is always smooth and natural, regardless
                                of the user's device.</p>

                            <p>Fluid motion is a powerful new feature that can be used to create beautiful and natural-looking motion in your user interfaces. They are easy to use and can be customized to match your app's branding. If you are looking to
                                create a modern and stylish app, fluid motion is a great option.</p>

                            <b>Here are some examples of how you can use fluid motion in your app:</b>

                            <br/>

                            <h4>Details about the SliverMainAxisGroup and SliverCrossAxisGroup widgets in Flutter:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>SliverMainAxisGroup is a widget that places its children in a linear array along the main axis of its parent.</li>
                                <li>SliverCrossAxisGroup is a widget that places its children in a linear array along the cross axis of its parent.</li>
                                <li>Both widgets are used to create layouts that are made up of multiple slivers.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The main difference between the two widgets is the direction in which they place their children. The SliverMainAxisGroup places its children along the main axis of its parent, which is the vertical axis on a phone or tablet.
                                The SliverCrossAxisGroup places its children along the cross axis of its parent, which is the horizontal axis on a phone or tablet.</p>

                            <p>Both widgets take a list of children as their argument. The children are arranged in the order that they are provided in the list.</p>

                            <p>The SliverMainAxisGroup and SliverCrossAxisGroup widgets are both very versatile and can be used to create a wide variety of layouts. They are a valuable tool for any Flutter developer who wants to create complex and responsive
                                layouts.
                            </p>

                            <p>Here is an example of how you can use the SliverMainAxisGroup widget to create a list of widgets:</p>
                            <pre><code>
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: CustomScrollView(
          slivers: [
            SliverMainAxisGroup(
              children: [
                Text('Hello, world!'),
                Text('This is a list of widgets.'),
                Text('The widgets are arranged in a linear array.'),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

</code></pre>

                            <p>In this example, we are using the SliverMainAxisGroup widget to create a list of three widgets. The widgets are arranged in a linear array, from top to bottom.</p>

                            <p>This is just a simple example of how you can use the SliverMainAxisGroup widget. There are many other ways to use the SliverMainAxisGroup widget to create complex and responsive layouts.</p>

                            <p>Here is an example of how you can use the SliverCrossAxisGroup widget to create a grid of widgets:</p>

                            <pre><code>
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: CustomScrollView(
          slivers: [
            SliverCrossAxisGroup(
              crossAxisSpacing: 10,
              mainAxisSpacing: 10,
              children: [
                Text('Hello, world!'),
                Text('This is a grid of widgets.'),
                Text('The widgets are arranged in a grid.'),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
</code></pre>

                            <h1>Error property for InputDecoration </h1>
                            <br/>

                            <p>The error property for the InputDecoration widget in Flutter is used to set the text that is displayed when the input is invalid. The text can be customized to be anything you want, but it is typically used to display an error
                                message.
                            </p>

                            <p>The error property takes a string as its argument. The string is the text that will be displayed when the input is invalid.</p>

                            <p>Here is an example of how you can use the error property:</p>

                            <pre><code>
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: TextFormField(
          decoration: InputDecoration(
            error: 'This is an invalid input',
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
</code></pre>

                            <p>In this example, we are using the error property to set the text "This is an invalid input". This text will be displayed when the user enters an invalid input into the text field.</p>

                            <p>The error property can be used to customize the appearance of the error text. For example, you can change the color of the text, the font size, or the font weight. You can also add a border around the text field.</p>

                            <h4>Here is an example of how you can customize the appearance of the error text:</h4>
                            <pre><code>
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: TextFormField(
          decoration: InputDecoration(
            errorStyle: TextStyle(
              color: Colors.red,
              fontSize: 16,
              fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
            ),
            errorBorder: OutlineInputBorder(
              borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(5),
              borderSide: BorderSide(color: Colors.red),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
</code></pre>
                            <p>In this example, we are changing the color of the error text to red, the font size to 16, and the font weight to bold. We are also adding a red border around the text field.</p>

                            <h4>Here are some other things to keep in mind when using the error property:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The error property is typically used in conjunction with the validator property. The validator property is used to validate the input, and the error property is used to display an error message if the input is invalid.</li>
                                <li>The error property can be used to display a message that is specific to the type of input. For example, if the input is a text field, you could display a message that says "Please enter a valid text."</li>
                                <li>The error property can be used to display a message that is localized. This means that the message will be displayed in the language that the user is using.</li>
                            </ul>


                        </p>

                            <p>The unsubmittedToSearchBar method for the TextEditingController class in Flutter is used to get the text that has not been submitted to the search bar yet. The text can be used to display a placeholder text or to prefill the
                                search bar when the user opens it.</p>

                            <p>The unsubmittedToSearchBar method takes no arguments.</p>

                            <p>Here is an example of how you can use the unsubmittedToSearchBar method:</p>

      ),
    );
  }
}
</code></pre>
                            <p>In this example, we are using the unsubmittedToSearchBar method to set the placeholder text for the text field. The placeholder text will be displayed when the text field is empty.</p>

                            <p>The unsubmittedToSearchBar method can also be used to prefill the search bar when the user opens it. To do this, you would set the unsubmittedToSearchBar property to the text that you want to prefill the search bar with.</p>

                            <p>Here is an example of how you can prefill the search bar:</p>
